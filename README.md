# Electron Diffraction Tools

Diffraction Center: Loads .dm3 diffraction patterns, centers them using the undiffracted beam, and transforms to polar cooords for rotational averaging.

diffraction rings: Generates example ring diffraction patterns of basic crystal types for comparison to data.

File Parse: Shows how to load .dm3 data with hyperspy.
